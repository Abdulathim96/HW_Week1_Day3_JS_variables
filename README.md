### The Geometrizer
Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Store a radius into a variable.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

### The Temperature Converter
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
